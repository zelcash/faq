            </div>
            <p class="answer">In ZelCore, contacts are your saved addresses. For example, when you send or receive coins from an exchange, or any other 3rd party (friends) you can assign a name to that address for future use.
              For coins with zk-SNARKS, you can save both Z-Addresses (Shielded) or T-Addresses (Transparent) in your contacts.

            </div>
            <p class="answer">When a user opts to run a FullNode wallet, ZelCore will download a copy of the full blockchain of the selected coin on the user's computer.
              This is only recommended for the users who want to use private Z-addresses, as using FullNode will consume extra system resources (CPU and Storage.)

            </div>

              <span class="faq-t"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">Once the FullNode is downloaded for a coin in ZelCore, ‘Peers’ display the number of peer-to-peer connections ZelCore has made with other Nodes for that coin.
              <br>
              The height is the number of blocks in the blockchain between it and the genesis block (genesis block height is 0). When 100% synced, the user should see the most recent block height numbers as per the coins explorer.
              <br>
              Each block on the blockchain is identified by a block header. When a wallet is 100% synced, the headers show the most recent block height.

            </div>
            <p class="answer">A private key is not a wallet address. It is a key to access your funds. Private Keys unlock and allow transfer of funds from your wallet.
              If you lose it, you practically lose access to your funds. Treat your private keys like the keys to your house, make sure you have a spare copy stored somewhere safe.

              <h2 class="question">What is the encryption key?<span class="ptag">key, encryptionkey, encryption key, security</span></h2>
              <span class="faq-t"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">The encryption key is used by ZelCore to encrypt all the wallets in ZelCore.
              When a new account with a new username and password is created ZelCore takes the password and creates a salted hash from it. ZelCore then adds the username to that salted hash and creates another salted hash from that value. This value (SHA256 hash) is the user’s encryption key.
              <br>
              The encryption key is used to encrypt both contacts.json and wallet.dat files with the AES-256-CTR algorithm.
              <br>
              When a user selects a coin in FullNode for the first time, ZelCore accesses the coins default path and reads its wallet.dat file.
              <br>
              If the wallet.dat file exists and has not been used, ZelCore creates a backup called (wallet.dat*TIMESTAMP*BACKUP) and uses it to access the addresses inside of the wallet.dat.
              <br>
              When ZelCore closes the coins daemon and other FullNode processes are shutdown. ZelCore then takes this wallet.dat and encrypts it with the encryption key and then gives the output of wallet.datUSERNAME , allowing for multiple users on the same device and increased security.

              <span class="faq-t"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">To run ZelCore with no FullNodes activated you need roughly 300 MB. It is not recommended to download FullNode for coins other than those you require Z-addresses for. Currently, Zelcash FullNode requires about 700 MB at the moment.
              Zcash FullNode requires around 2GB at the moment.
              Bitcoin FullNodes are expected to be up to 300 GB.
              So the amount of disk space required will change from coin to coin.

            </div>
            <p class="answer">ZelCore is encrypted and backed up by default. When you log into ZelCore, all the wallets are decrypted. So it is advisable to logout or quit/exit out of ZelCore when you are not using it to allow ZelCore to encrypt and back-itself-up.</p>

              <span class="faq-t"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">ZelCore does not keep a copy of unencrypted password locally nor remotely. Due to this feature, there's no way to retrieve the password nor to change it.
              When you lose (or forget) either username or password, you will lose access to your wallet PERMANENTLY. Thus it is IMPORTANT and IMPERATIVE that you keep a copy of your information somewhere safe.
